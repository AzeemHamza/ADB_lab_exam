## üõ∞Ô∏è Project Overview

This is a small, well-scoped backend for ingesting and serving **flight tracking data**. It provides HTTP APIs to receive tracking updates from receivers, store flight logs in a MongoDB database, and expose flight and history endpoints for clients to query positions and flight paths. The project also includes utilities for validation and simple mapping/visualization helpers (Folium + Matplotlib are available in the requirements).

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Tracking ingestion** ‚Äî Receivers POST tracking updates to the server to record positions and telemetry.
* **Flight management API** ‚Äî List active flights and fetch flight histories / paths.
* **Receiver management** ‚Äî Store receiver IDs and index receiver records for efficient queries.
* **Indexes & performance** ‚Äî The database code creates helpful indexes for time-based queries and receiver lookups.
* **Mapping support** ‚Äî Lightweight mapping utilities (Folium) for quickly rendering flight paths for debugging / demoing.
* **Tests** ‚Äî A pytest-based test dependency is included for running unit tests.

## üõ† Tech Stack & Dependencies

* **Framework:** Flask (Python)
* **Database:** MongoDB (using `pymongo` ‚Äî direct driver)

> Note: Several package files in the repository are named `_init_.py` (single underscore). For Python packages to work correctly, these should be renamed to `__init__.py` (two underscores) ‚Äî otherwise imports like `from routes.tracking_routes import tracking_bp` may fail. Fixing that is the first recommended step before running the app or tests.

## üîå Quick Setup & Run (local)

> These are the straightforward steps to get the project running locally. Adjust as needed for your environment.

1. **Ensure MongoDB is running locally** (or provide a remote MongoDB URI). If running locally, start `mongod` or use a Docker MongoDB container.

2. **Create and activate a Python virtualenv** (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows (PowerShell)
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root (example):
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/adb_lab_db
PORT=5000
```
`config.py` reads configuration from environment variables via `python-dotenv`.

5. **Fix package init files** (if present):
Make sure each package folder has a `__init__.py` (two underscores) ‚Äî rename `_init_.py` ‚Üí `__init__.py` where necessary.

6. **Start the server**:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development   # optional
flask run --port=5000
# or
python app.py
```

Server will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you specify).

## üì° API Endpoints (available / observed)

The project exposes a handful of HTTP endpoints (the exact details are implemented in `routes/`):

* `POST /api/tracking/update` ‚Äî Ingest tracking updates from receivers. (JSON body; validated by `utils.validators`.)
* `GET  /api/flights` ‚Äî List flights (supports optional query filters such as `status`).
* `GET  /api/flights/<flight_id>/history` ‚Äî Retrieve complete flight path / history for a flight.

> There are additional helpers/routes for receivers and position queries in `routes/` (see `flight_routes.py`, `tracking_routes.py`, `receiver_routes.py`). For exact request/response shapes, check `utils/validators.py` and the service implementations in `services/`.

### Example (approximate) tracking payload
```json
{
  "flight_id": "FLIGHT123",
  "receiver_id": "RCV-01",
  "latitude": 32.98765,
  "longitude": 74.12345,
  "altitude": 1200,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T12:34:56Z"
}
```
> Use the exact schema enforced by `utils.validators.validate_tracking_data` when sending real data.

## üß™ Running Tests

If tests exist, run them with pytest:
```bash
pytest -q
```

If you get import errors, double-check that `__init__.py` files are correctly named and that the virtual environment has the required packages installed.

---

## üìù Tips & Troubleshooting

* **Renaming `_init_.py`**: This is the single most likely cause of import-time failures ‚Äî please rename to `__init__.py` in package directories (`routes/`, `models/`, `services/`, etc.).  
* **Mongo connectivity**: If the app can‚Äôt connect to MongoDB, verify `MONGO_URI` and that the server is reachable. Use `mongo` shell or Compass to check.  
* **Indexing**: The database wrapper auto-creates indexes (e.g., time-based indexes). If you re-seed data or change schema, drop/recreate indexes as needed during development.
* **Empty docs**: The `docs/` folder has placeholders for API and schema documentation; consider filling them out before submission for full marks.
